    "# Sentiment Classification of Restaurant Reviews using OpenAI LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function to classify the sentiment of a restaurant review using OpenAI API\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This notebook leverages OpenAI's LLMs to classify the sentiment of restaurant reviews as positive, negative or neutral. It demonstrates how to use an API-based classification approach by sending review texts to a language model and interpreting its responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The goal is to generate reliable sentiment labels for supervised learning or evaluation tasks. The notebook includes a wrapper function for model calls, test examples, and dataset preprocessing for bulk classification. **We applied the same method as in the llm_judge_train dataset in order to evaluate Vader and Bert methods applying confusion matrix usinf the llm as a judge.**"
